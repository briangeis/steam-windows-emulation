Tutorial on how to use Steam for Linux as a Windows emulator.

## Overview

Steam is a digital content distribution service developed by Valve.
As most games are developed for the Windows platform, Valve created
an open-source tool called Proton for the Steam Linux client.
Proton acts as Windows compatibility layer for Linux, allowing games
exclusive to Windows to run on Linux.

While Proton was developed for allowing Windows games to run on Linux,
it can also be used to to run *any* type of Windows software,
from games to productivity applications.
This allows Steam for Linux to serve as a Windows emulator that is easy
to setup and configure.

This tutorial will demonstrate this capability by using Steam for Linux
to install and configure Notepad++, a popular Windows text editor.
